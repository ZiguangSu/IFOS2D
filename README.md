# What is IFOS2D?

IFOS2D (Inversion of Full observed seismograms) is a 2D elastic full waveform inversion code.  
The inversion problem is solved by a conjugate gradient method and the gradients are computed in the time domain with the adjoint method.  
The forward modeling is done by a time domain finite difference scheme. The manual is included in the download archive or can be downloaded [here](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/IFOS2D/wikis/home)
