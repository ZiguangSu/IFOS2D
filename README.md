# What is DENISE?

DENISE (subwavelength DEtail resolving Nonlinear Iterative SEismic inversion) is a 2D elastic full waveform inversion code.  
The inversion problem is solved by a conjugate gradient method and the gradients are computed in the time domain with the adjoint method.  
The forward modeling is done by a time domain finite difference scheme. The manual is included in the download archive or can be downloaded [here](https://git.scc.kit.edu/GPIAG-Software/DENISE/wikis/home)
